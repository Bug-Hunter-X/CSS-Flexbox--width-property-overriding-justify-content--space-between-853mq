The following CSS rule creates an unexpected layout:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
div > * {
  width: 50%;
}
```

This might seem like it should make two child elements equally divide the space, but if the child elements have content that causes them to overflow (e.g., long text), the `width: 50%;` rule overrides the `justify-content: space-between` causing the elements to stack vertically or unexpectedly overlap, due to the calculation of 50% width overriding the space-between distribution.
