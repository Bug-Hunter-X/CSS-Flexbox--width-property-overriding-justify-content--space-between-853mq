To solve this, avoid using fixed width percentages when `justify-content: space-between` is used for flexible width distribution. Instead, use `flex-grow` to allow items to distribute available space proportionally.

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
div > * {
  flex-grow: 1;
}
```

This revised CSS ensures that the child elements will take up equal space between each other while respecting the content width of each element. If you need minimum widths, use `min-width` instead of fixed percentages.
